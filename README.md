As RTAB-Map one of the best solutions for SLAM to develop robots that can map environments in 3D, using this package to
create a 2D occupancy grid and 3D octomap. By developing a new package to interface with the rtabmap-ros package and deploy a
robot in a simulated environment using gazebo and RViz then using teleop to move around the environment to generate a proper map.
